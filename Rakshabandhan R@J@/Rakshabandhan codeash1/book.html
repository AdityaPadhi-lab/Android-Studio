          Raksha Bandhan fills my heart with warmth and nostalgia. I find myself reminiscing about the countless moments we've shared, each one contributing to the unbreakable bond we have today. From our childhood antics to the deep friendship we've built over the years, every memory with you is a treasure I hold dear. 
          You’ve always been there, not just as a sister, but as someone who understands me in ways no one else can.
